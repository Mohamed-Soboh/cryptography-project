Diffieâ€“Hellman key exchange method D-H,
Camellia is a symmetric key block cipher with a block size of 128 bits and key sizes of 128, 192 and 256 bits with Ecb mode
Rabin Signature in group of 3 users
The goal of this project is to offer a security data transfer from side to side through Camellia algorithm,
and how we attach to the message a digital signature that has the 3 goals integrity, authentication and the non-repudiation.
